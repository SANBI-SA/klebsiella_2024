title: Fetching and analysing data with shell scripts

### Task 2: Fetch and analyse data

In the `~/data` directory you will find two files: `file_list1.csv` and `file_list2.csv`. Here is a part of 
`file_list1.csv`:

```
SRR8364252,https://pathogen-genomics-march-2024.sanbi.ac.za/data/shell/reads/SRR8364252_1.fastq.gz
SRR8364252,https://pathogen-genomics-march-2024.sanbi.ac.za/data/shell/reads/SRR8364252_2.fastq.gz
SRR8364253,https://pathogen-genomics-march-2024.sanbi.ac.za/data/shell/reads/SRR8364253_1.fastq.gz
SRR8364253,https://pathogen-genomics-march-2024.sanbi.ac.za/data/shell/reads/SRR8364253_2.fastq.gz
```

The structure of the file is a list of sample names and then URLs for some gzipped FASTQ files. We would like to
fetch all the sequence files listed in `file_list1.txt`. Before that we need to focus on shell scripting.

#### Shell variables

Variables in the shell are either user variables or shell environment variables. Environment variables like
`HOME` and `PATH` are set in the shell environment and can be used to find out more about the shell environment,
for example where the user's home directory is or what locations the shell searches for programs to run.

User variables are set by the user and either used in their current shell session or by programs that the
user runs. Setting a variable looks like this:

```
MYVAR=value
```

Note that there is no space between the variable name and the value. The value set this way can be retrieved
using `$`. For example `echo $MYVAR`. Shell variables can either be UPPERCASE or lowercase, but using UPPERCASE is the
convention, so that these can be distinguished from e.g. the names of commands.

Shell variables can be specified using braces e.g. `echo ${MYVAR}`. These braces clearly distinguish where the shell
variable name starts and ends so that you can do things like `echo ${MYVAR}_word`. Without the braces `echo $MYVAR_word` would
be interpreted as a reference to a variable called `MYVAR_word`.

##### Advanced shell variable expansion

The [GNU Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) has a section on shell
variable expansion. Here are some advanced ways to use variables:

```bash
# print the value of MYVAR but if MYVAR is not defined, print Hello
echo ${MYVAR:-Hello}

MYVAR=/home/user/patrice
# print the part of the variable's value that comes after the first pattern match:
# this will print home/user/patrice
echo ${MYVAR#*/}

# print the part of the variable's value that comes after the last pattern match
# this will print patrice
echo ${MYVAR##*/}

# print the part of the variable's value that comes after the last pattern match
# this will print /home/user
echo ${MYVAR%/*}

# print the part of the variable's value that comes after the first pattern match
# this will print a blank line
echo ${MYVAR%%/*}
```

#### Shell scripts

A shell script is a collection of commands, typically stored in a file whose name ends in `.sh`. E.g. `fetch.sh`. A shell script
should have

`#!/bin/bash`

as its first line. This line is not interpreted by Bash itself (it starts with `#`, the comment character), but it tells the Linux or Unix
system what command to use to interpret the commands in the file.

The are two ways to run a shell script. Either you can tell `bash` to run the script, e.g.:

```bash
bash fetch.sh
```

Or, if you make the shell script file executable with the `chmod a+x` command, you can run the script my referring to its name (including the 
full or relative path), e.g.

```bash
# only works after chmod a+x fetch.sh
./fetch.sh
```

##### Shell parameter variables

Any parameters that you pass on the command line are passed to the shell script as variables named `$1`, `$2`, etc based on the position of the parameter
in the command line. The number of parameters used in the command line will be listed in the `$#` variable. E.g. in a script called `test1.sh` which
contains:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of parameters: $#"
echo Param1: $1
echo Param2: $2
```

If you run `./test1.sh one two three` you will see:

```
Number of parameters: 3
Param1: one
Param2: two
```

And if you run ./test1.sh one` you will see:

```
Number of parameters: 1
Param1: one
Param2:
```

Notice that in the first example the third parameter is ignored and in the second example the second parameter is blank.

##### Shell flags

You can set some special flags in a shell script. In `test.sh` with the contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# exit if any errors are encountered
set -e

# print the commands as they are executed (useful for debugging)
set -x

# make it an error to use an undefined variable
set -u

# if any part of a pipe files, make trigger an error

set -o pipefile
```

The `set -e` option is especially recommended because it stops a shell script from continuing past the first error that it encounters.

#### Shell loops

The Bash shell supports several different types of loops. The basics of shell loops are explained in
[this Software Carpentry lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop.html). In essence, the loop is
a _foreach_ loop. For each element provided it will run once.

```bash
for LOOPVAR in one two three ; do
    echo $LOOPVAR
done
```

will print:

```
one
two
three
```

The Bash shell `$()` syntax provides an effective way to create lists to loop over. E.g. `$(cat myfile.txt)` creates a list of all the
lines in the file and runs the loop once for each line (and for each word in a line if the lines have spaces in them).




1. Look at file_list1
2. Write a loop to fetch data
  2.1. dealing with incomplete fetch
3. Checksums - check if the data is right
4. Which is the smallest sample?
5. zcat / zmore - looking inside a file
6. count the number of reads in the files

## Basic tutorial on nextflow

For this exercise, we will follow the tutorial on
<https://training.nextflow.io/basic_training/setup/> and use
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - an open-source Kubernetes application for
ready-to-code cloud development environments that spins up fresh, automated dev
environments for each task, in the cloud, in seconds. It enables you to describe
your dev environment as code and start instant, remote and cloud development
environments directly from your browser or your Desktop IDE.

## Additional Bioinformatics and Genomic Epidemiology Learning Resources

While each section of this course has introduced learning resources, some don't fit into any of the specific topics, so are gathered here.

* [Awesome Bioinformatics Education](https://github.com/lskatz/awesome-bioinformatics-education) - a curated list of resources for learning bioinformatics (with a focus on pathogen bioinformatics). The list is curated by Dr Lee Katz from the US CDC.

* [An applied genomic epidemiology handbook](https://alliblk.github.io/genepi-book/) - the free version of Allison Black and Gytis Dudas' [textbook](https://www.routledge.com/The-Applied-Genomic-Epidemiology-Handbook-A-Practical-Guide-to-Leveraging-Pathogen-Genomic-Data-in-Public-Health/Black-Dudas/p/book/9781032530260) on genomic epidemiology.

* [Primer on Phylogenetics](http://phyloseminar.org/recorded.html) - search for "Primer" in the recordings of the PhyloSeminars

* [Glittr](https://glittr.org/?per_page=25&sort_by=stargazers&sort_direction=desc) - Git repositories with bioinformatics training material
